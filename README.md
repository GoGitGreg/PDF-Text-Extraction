# PDF-Text-Extraction

Simple idea.  

Take a pdf file, convert it to a text file, and then apply some natural language processing to analyze the file.

The code will essentially convert the pdf to a text file, save it to your directory, and create an "insight" text file that has some basic information about the pdf file.  Popular words, etc.
